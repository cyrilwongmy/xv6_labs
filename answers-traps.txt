It's taken from the stack. You are telling printf that it can fetch 2 arguments from the stack but you only provide 1 argument. 
Printf doesn't know about this and takes the next value on the stack which is most likely the value of a register saved during invocation of printf.

But note: The value you get is always undefined.
